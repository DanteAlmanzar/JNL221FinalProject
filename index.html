    <h1> Gun Ownership and the Impact it has on New York State Crime Rate</h1>

    <p> Tracking how firearm ownership has affected violent crime rates in the state of New York since 1990. </p>

    <p> Gun ownership is a heated topic in the United States. Mass shootings and other gun-related violent crimes have plagued the country and political debates increasingly over the years. Despite the state of New York having relatively strict gun restrictions, that does not make the state immune to gun-related crimes. </p>

    <p> In New York, counties with higher firearm rates tend to have higher violent crime rates. This is especially true in counties with higher populations, such as the Bronx, Kings and New York County, which hold more than 25% of the state’s population on their own. </p>

   <p> Violent crime rate is calculated by dividing the number of crimes committed in an area by the population, then multiplying it by 100,000. Firearm rate is calculated the same way but with the number of registered firearms owned in a certain area.</p>

    <p>This is important to understand because of the diverse geography of the state. Counties with smaller populations would not require nearly as much crime to have the same rate as one of the five boroughs. It is also important to understand that the counties with large cities are also affected by factors such as a high population density, economic inequality and social challenges. 
    </p>

    <p> In the 80s and 90s these factors culminated in some of the highest crime rates in the country. New York City became notorious for its high crime rates and this correlated to a firearm rate that more than doubled what it was in 2022. While of course many factors contributed to this steep decline in violent crime, it’s no coincidence that a decrease in firearm rates accompanied it.

    <p> One of the leading factors in this decrease was gun control. The state of New York is one of the states that are at the forefront of gun control legislation. They conduct extensive background checks and issue waiting periods on those seeking to purchase a firearm. 
    </p>

    <p>There is also a statewide assault weapons ban, making it one of seven states, along with the District of Columbia, to introduce such a ban. Magazine capacity limits, along with requiring licenses for handguns are other measures that several other states lack. New York also does not have an open carry law for handguns and issues very few concealed carry permits.
